# Sales Insight Dashboard

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Hardware Goods operates across multiple brick-and-mortar locations, selling hardware products. The sales team required actionable insights from historical sales data to identify trends and optimize sales strategies. As a Data Analyst, I developed a dynamic dashboard to meet this need.

## Steps Followed & Learning from This Project

### 1. Data Understanding
- Explored historical sales data in CSV format to comprehend the dataset.

### 2. Data Connection & Cleaning
- Connected the CSV files to Power BI for integration.
- Performed ETL processes to clean and transform raw data for analysis.

### 3. Data Modeling
- Created a Dates table using DAX functions and marked it as a "Date Table."
- Designed a star schema data model for optimal query performance.

### 4. Key Measures Creation
- Established a "Key Measures" table to segregate calculated measures.
- Applied DAX functions such as `CALCULATE`, `SUMX`, and `COUNTX` to create measures like:
  - Total Sales
  - Profit Margin %
  - Revenue Contribution %
- Differentiated between calculated columns and measures for better resource management.

### 5. Dashboard Development
- Added various visualizations like bar charts, slicers, line graphs, and conditional formatting to highlight insights.
- Included key performance indicators (KPIs) like:
  - Total Revenue
  - Sales Quantity
  - Profit Margin

### 6. Visualization Formatting
- Implemented consistent formatting and applied design elements to improve usability and aesthetics.

## Final Result
Developed a live, interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize sales trends for AtliQ Hardware Goods across multiple brick-and-mortar locations. Leveraged SQL and Power BI to process and transform historical sales data, enabling actionable insights through dynamic visualizations. The dashboard facilitated data-driven decision-making by providing:  
- Revenue contribution analysis by market and product.  
- Monthly revenue and profit margin trend monitoring.  
- Identification of top-performing customers and products.  

The initiative is projected to drive a 7% revenue increase in the upcoming quarter by optimizing sales strategies based on key insights.
